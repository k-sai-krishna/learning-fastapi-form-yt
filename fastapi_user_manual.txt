!installation and setup
your python version should be 3.6 or greater
now download fastapi using terminal 
pip install fastapi
one can use fastapi globally or any virtual environment
to create a vitual environment use, python3 -m venv environment_name (-m stands for mode)
now to activate the environment that we have created earlier use, source environment_name/bin/activate (in linux and macOS)
now install fastapi in the current created environment with, pip install fastapi
now install uvicorn within the environment with, pip3 install uvicorn
try to check the version of the uvicorn with, uvicorn --version output is as follows
Running uvicorn 0.30.3 with CPython 3.12.3 on Linux.
remember that you have installed the uvicorn in your virtual environment only so it won't get installed in globally or outside of that environment. to verify above statement open terminal in any other location and type, uvicorn --version, you will get command not found message


open vscode in the virtual environment location (or just type 'code .' in the terminal)
now create main.py file in the current directory (in terminal touch 'main.py'(to open terminal in vscode type 'ctrl+`'))
in that file (main.py) type,

from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI() #creating an object (instance) 
def index():
	return 'heyy'

now to run the server in fastapi use, uvicorn main:app --reload in vscodes' terminal(to open terminal in vscode type 'ctrl+`')
now we will get the localhost link in the terminal then we open that link in the browser
at this point the browser says {'detail':'not found'} error(in terminal you get 404 not found error)
that means we have missed the path so to resolve this error we make changes to our code like below 

from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI() #creating an object (instance) 
@app.get('/')#means open this in the base url of localhost
def index():
	return 'heyy'
	
now we will need to rerun the server and reload the localhost tab in the browser(to stop the server use 'ctrl+c' in the terminal)
now we get 'heyy' in the localhost page
we can return a dictionary to the webpage by modifying above code as

from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI() #creating an object (instance) 
@app.get('/')#means open this in the base url of localhost
def index():
	return {'student':{'name':'kotha sai krishna'}}

now open a webpage that is located in the localhost:8000/about/ with following code

from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get('/about')
def about():#may have any name not exactly 'above'
	return {'student':{'name':'kotha sai krishna'}}
	
break it down 
file_name : main.py
code:
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI() #creating an object (instance) 
@app.get('/')#means open this in the base url of localhost
def index():
	return {'student':{'name':'kotha sai krishna'}}
	
to run the server with above code use, uvicorn main:app 
or to reload the server while working within the project use, uvicorn main:app --reload
syntax to run the server: uvicorn file_name:object_name --reload

@app is called as path operation decorator
get() is an operation 
string between the paranthesis of get method is called as path or route(in another frameworks)
the function below the pathe operator decoratored function is known as path operation function


path parameters
#to make a page somewhat dynamic we use this type of code

usage 1:
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get('/{id}')#take input from the user from the browsers' url
def index(id):
	return id

in browsers' url type localhost:8000/777
output: "777"

usage 2:
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get('/{i}/home')
def index(k):
	return {'data':k}

in browsers' url type localhost:8000/krishna
output: {'data':'krishna'}
making type constraint to the parameters

from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get('/{bar}')
def index(bar: int):
	return {'data':{'bar':bar}}
	
in browsers' url type localhost:8000/343
output: {'data':{'bar':343}}

if you type other type of data it will through an error that can be understood easily i.e., 
i enter in the usl like this localhost:8000/32s
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "int_parsing",
      "loc": [
        "path",
        "i"
      ],
      "msg": "Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer",
      "input": "32s"
    }
  ]
}
